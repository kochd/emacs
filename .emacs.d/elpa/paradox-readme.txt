Project for modernizing Emacs' Package Menu. With package ratings,
usage statistics, customizability, and more.

Usage
===

To install it, call M-x `package-install' RET paradox.

To use it, simply call M-x `paradox-list-packages' (instead of the
regular `list-packages').
This will give you most features out of the box. If you want to be
able to star packages as well, just configure the
`paradox-github-token' variable then call `paradox-list-packages'
again.

If you'd like to stop using Paradox, you may call `paradox-disable'
and go back to using the regular `list-packages'.

## Current Features ##

### Package Ratings ###

The first feature you should know about is our integration with
**GitHub Stars**, which works as *rough package rating* system.
That is, Paradox package menu will:

1. Display the number of GitHub Stars each package has (assuming it's
   in a github repo, of course);
2. Automatically star packages you install, and unstar packages you delete;
3. Let you star and unstar packages by hitting the `s' key;
4. Let you star all packages you have installed with M-x `paradox-star-all-installed-packages'.

Item **1.** will work out of the box, the other items obviously
require a github account (Paradox will help you generate a token the
first time you call `paradox-list-packages').

### Several Improvements ###

Other features include many small improvements to the package menu
itself and also work out of the box.

* Shortcuts for package filtering:
    * <f r> filters by regexp (`occur');
    * <f u> display only packages with upgrades;
    * <f k> filters by keyword (emacs 24.4 only).
* `hl-line-mode' enabled by default.
* Display useful information on the mode-line and cleanup a bunch of
  useless stuff (customizable).
* Customization! Just call M-x `paradox-customize' to see what you can
  do.
    * Customize column widths.
    * Customize faces (`paradox-star-face',
      `paradox-status-face-alist' and `paradox-archive-face').
    * Customize local variables.
